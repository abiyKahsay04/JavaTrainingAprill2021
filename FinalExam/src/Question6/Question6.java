	/* Write a java method which takes an array of integers as a parameter, and return “MagicArray” 
	if the array contains at least one element divisible by 3 otherwise return “non MagicArray”.
	Example: 
	{4, 6, 5, 12} - is MagicArray because 6 and 12 are divisible by 3
	{4, 7, 2, 8, 10} - is non MagicArray because none of the elements are divisible by 3.
	{ 4, 7, 11, 6} - MagicArray */
